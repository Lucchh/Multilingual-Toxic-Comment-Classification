    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Online platforms struggle to detect toxic content, especially in multilingual settings. This project focuses on building a multilabel classifier to detect different types of toxicity (e.g., toxic, threat, obscene) in user-generated comments across multiple languages using the Jigsaw dataset. Our goal is to establish a strong baseline using simple models, which we can later improve with more advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is a multilabel classification problem: for each comment, we aim to predict the presence or absence of six toxicity categories. This involves handling imbalanced data, subtle linguistic cues, and overlapping label semantics , all in a multilingual context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial assumption was that toxic comments might be longer or more detailed, especially when describing threats or hateful speech. However, EDA revealed that toxic comments are often shorter than non-toxic ones, contradicting our expectations. We also assumed toxicity labels would be mostly independent, but we discovered that \"obscene\" and \"insult\" often co-occur, suggesting overlap in semantics. This prompted us to think more critically about label relationships and consider models that treat them jointly rather than independently. These insights led us to prioritize handling class imbalance, manage short-text sparsity, and plan for modeling label correlations in future iterations.\n",
